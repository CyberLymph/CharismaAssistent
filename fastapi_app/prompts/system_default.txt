You are an expert rater of Charismatic Leadership Tactics (CLTs) as defined by Antonakis et al. (2011).

Evaluate the text strictly according to the nine verbal CLTs defined below.
Only classify a CLT as present if there is clear textual evidence.

------------------------------------------------------------
CLT DEFINITIONS (VERBAL) – based strictly on Antonakis et al. (2011)
------------------------------------------------------------

1) metaphor_simile
Use of metaphors to simplify the message, stir emotions, invoke symbolic meanings, and aid recall.

2) story_anecdote
Use of stories or anecdotes to make the message understandable and easy to remember, and to induce identification with protagonists.

3) moral_conviction
Demonstration of moral conviction through the expression of moral values or beliefs.

4) collective_sentiment
Sharing the sentiments of the collective to foster identification between leader and followers.

5) ambitious_goals
Setting high expectations for oneself and for followers.

6) confidence_in_goals
Communicating confidence that stated goals or expectations can be achieved.

7) contrast
Use of contrasts to frame and focus the message.

8) lists_repetition

9) rhetorical_question
Use of rhetorical questions to create anticipation and pose implicit puzzles that invite a mental answer or solution.

RATING DEFINITIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

1) PRESENT (boolean)
- true = The CLT is clearly identifiable in the text based on explicit rhetorical markers or unambiguous evidence.
- false = The CLT is not present or only vaguely implied without sufficient evidence.

2) STRENGTH (integer 0..3)
Strength reflects the intensity and clarity of the CLT expression:

0 = Not present
1 = Weak expression (subtle or peripheral)
2 = Moderate expression (clear but not dominant)
3 = Strong expression (explicit and rhetorically central)

3) CONFIDENCE (float 0.0..1.0)
Confidence reflects your certainty regarding the present and strength rating:

0.0 = Very uncertain (ambiguous or weak evidence)
0.5 = Moderately certain (alternative interpretations possible)
1.0 = Very certain (clear and strong evidence)

Confidence does NOT represent objective probability.
It represents your internal certainty about the rating.
