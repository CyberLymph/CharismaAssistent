You must produce ONE JSON object that conforms EXACTLY to this schema:

{
  "meta": {
    "setup": { "clts": 9, "llm_runs": 1, "mode": "fulltext" },
    "consistency": null
  },
  "overall_score": 0,
  "items": [
    {
      "clt_id": "moral_conviction",
      "label": "Moral Conviction",
      "present": false,
      "strength": 0,
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "evidence": [ { "quote": "..." } ],
      "rationale_short": "..."
    }
  ]
}

Hard constraints:
- Output ONLY these fields. Do not include any other keys anywhere.
- items MUST contain exactly 9 objects.
- Each of the nine CLTs MUST appear exactly once in items (no duplicates, none missing).
- clt_id MUST be exactly one of these strings:
  moral_conviction
  collective_sentiment
  lists_repetition
  rhetorical_question
  contrast
  story_anecdote
  metaphor_simile
  ambitious_goals
  confidence_in_goals
- label MUST match the clt_id as follows:
  moral_conviction -> "Moral Conviction"
  collective_sentiment -> "Collective Sentiment"
  lists_repetition -> "Lists / Repetition"
  rhetorical_question -> "Rhetorical Question"
  contrast -> "Contrast"
  story_anecdote -> "Story / Anecdote"
  metaphor_simile -> "Metaphor / Simile"
  ambitious_goals -> "Ambitious Goals"
  confidence_in_goals -> "Confidence in Goals"
- present MUST be a boolean (true/false).
- strength MUST be an integer 0..3.
- confidence MUST be a float 0.0..1.0.
- evidence MUST be a list of objects with key "quote" only.
- Each evidence.quote MUST be a short verbatim span copied from the speech text (no paraphrases, no invented text).
- If present=false, you MUST set strength=0 and evidence=[].
- If present=true, you MUST include at least one evidence quote.
- rationale_short MUST be a short explanation (max 280 characters).
- Use ONLY the nine CLTs. Do not invent additional CLTs.

meta rules:
- meta.setup.clts MUST be 9.
- meta.setup.llm_runs MUST be 1.
- meta.setup.mode MUST be either "fulltext" or "hybrid" (choose the one that applies).
- meta.consistency MUST be null.

overall_score rules:
- overall_score MUST be an integer 0..100 (no decimals).
- Compute overall_score exactly as:
  round( ( sum over all 9 items of ((strength/3) * confidence) / 9 ) * 100 )
- Use the numeric values exactly as you output them in the items.

Follow strictly the rating definitions provided in the system instructions for:
- present
- strength
- confidence
Do not invent alternative interpretations of these scales.
