You must produce ONE JSON object that conforms EXACTLY to this schema:

{
  "meta": {
    "setup": { "clts": 9, "llm_runs": 1, "mode": "..." },
    "consistency": null
  },
  "overall_score": 0,
  "items": [
    {
      "clt_id": "moral_conviction",
      "label": "Moral Conviction",
      "present": false,

      "confidence": 0.0,
      "evidence": [ { "quote": "..." } ],

  4) rhetorical_question
  5) contrast
  6) story_anecdote
